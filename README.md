# Challenge3-PasswordGenerator
In this proyect I used HTML, CSS and JS to build a password generator 

<h2>Description</h2>

Password generator allows us to create a random password based on the needs and preferences of the user. The user can choose:
- password length (between 8 and 128 characters)
- use special characters
- use numbers
- use lower case
- use upper case

A password generator can be very useful nowadays, since all the platforms with which we interact require a password. 

<h2>Built With</h2> 

- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript 

<h2>Credits</h2>
In order to complete this challenge, I applied the knowledge seen in class, as well as additional resources on the Internet, such as articles and videos.
